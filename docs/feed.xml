<p>The thing I love most about Linux is the stability.</p>

<p>Years ago, I had grown to hate Apple for asking me to allow minor updates, only to find out they had done massive app-breaking updates instead.</p>

<p>This was happening weekly until enough was enough.  So, I switched to Linux and have been quite happy ever since.</p>

<p>After a brief run w/ Elementary, I moved to Zorin.  Zorin 16 has been my home for the last 3 years, and it’s been pure bliss.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Over these same few years, a trend has been unfolding on Github w/ developers offering pre-built apps and games that you don’t have to compile.</p>

<p>This saves me a bunch of trouble, so I’ve been all for it.</p>

<p>But I’ve finally hit a wall.  These pre-built apps no longer work on my machine, as I’ve been getting a dreaded error:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./QSS-M-l64: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.33' not found (required by ./QSS-M-l64)
./QSS-M-l64: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by ./QSS-M-l64)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As it turns out, this GLIBC error is translated as “your OS is too old, and you are being left behind.”  An error w/ GLIBC is the kiss of death.</p>

<p>Trying to compile these apps myself resulted in the same errors.  Trying this guy’s <a href="https://www.jertype.com/upgrading-glibc/">tip</a> for compiling an updated GLIBC didn’t work either.</p>

<p>Who knew a 3 year old OS was too old, but aparently that’s how it works in Linux world.  You gotta keep moving w/ the herd.</p>

<p>So I’m prepping for my big update tomorrow to Zorin 17.</p>

<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>

<p>The reason I even make this post is to have a reason to share my migration shell script.</p>

<p>I presumptively will have to do this major OS upgrade every 2 years, so this is how I’m doing it.  This solves the question of how to temporarily back up my stuff while I install a fresh OS, and then move it back.</p>

<p>Am not doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m not using the OS updater, bc I like the idea of a clean slate</li>
  <li>I’m not using a backup app, bc it backs up my entire home directory (see point #1)</li>
  <li>I’m not using my home server to store my files, bc internet connections are too slow for the amount of data I need to move</li>
</ul>

<p>Am doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m using a 1TB external drive, which is super fast over USB3</li>
  <li>I’m using RSYNC bc it’s awesome and can be run repeatedly w/out issues or wasted time</li>
</ul>

<p>The script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash

BACKUP="/media/myuser/myexternaldrive"

# check if backup directory exists
if [ ! -d "$BACKUP" ]; then
    echo "Backup directory $BACKUP not found. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

cd ~

# backup bashrc
cp ~/.bashrc ${BACKUP}/bashrc.txt

# backup crontab
crontab -l &gt; ${BACKUP}/crontab.txt

# backup ssh folder

# backup game save files

# die early (comment off for database dump)
exit 1

# backup mysql databases
USER="myuser"
PASSWORD="mypass"
mysql -u$USER -p$PASSWORD -e 'SHOW DATABASES;' | grep -Ev "(Database|information_schema|performance_schema)" | while read dbname; do
    mysqldump ${dbname} &gt; ${dbname}.sql --add-drop-table --lock-tables=false --user=$USER --password=$PASSWORD
done

rm -rf ${BACKUP}/Data/
mkdir ${BACKUP}/Data/
mv ~/*.sql ${BACKUP}/Data/.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Wish me luck.  If I never post on here again, well… it means my upgrade failed.</p>

<p class="caption">WARNING!  These install instructions require a high degree of nerdery, involving Terminal commands, shell scripts, TMUX sessions, and more.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>There has always been something special about Terraria.  It has a vibe that’s easy to relax to.  That <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie3wHI5JYKM">rain</a> soundtrack hits the spot.</p>

<p>For the game being as old as it is, it’s changed quite a bit.  The version I like to play is 1.3.5.3 (released 2017).</p>

<p>(Felt like the defeat of the Moon Lord should have been the end of the game.)</p>

<p>This older version of the game is Linux native and is much less resource intensive on my machine than the newer 1.4 versions.</p>

<p>Terraria is a family favorite w/ my kids.  It’s loads of fun to start a playthru on a dedicated server and roll thru the game together.</p>

<p>I’ll show you how I do it at my house.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>You’re looking for the Linux installer for 1.3.5.3, which can be hard to find, but if you know where to look you can find it.</p>

<p>The install file is a shell script, which you can run from Terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /path/to/installer/
$ sh installer.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you run this, a visual installer UI will open up and guide you thru the process.</p>

<h2 id="amending-the-start-script">Amending The Start Script</h2>

<p>Once installed, you’re going to have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start.sh</code> file in the game directory.  This is the file that you’ll be using to launch the game.</p>

<p>Before you do that, you’ll need to make a few changes to the script so you can control how the game runs on your machine.</p>

<p>Open it up in a text editor and make these changes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// must put at the top (or game won't launch)
export TERM=xterm

// if you have NVIDIA card, add these to the top too
export __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1
export __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
export __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only

// if you have Gamemode
// find './"Terraria"' and change to 'gamemoderun ./"Terraria"'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can run the game in Terminal with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sh start.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code> as an alias:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alias terraria="cd /path/to/terraria &amp;&amp; sh start.sh"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Reset Terminal so it reloads the config:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ source ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run it easily from any directory:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ terraria
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="fixing-the-keyboard">Fixing The Keyboard</h2>

<p>There is a problem on Linux machines where your character won’t move properly, he will stutter and act weird on ropes.</p>

<p>The problem has to do w/ how Linux handles repeating keys on the keyboard, but you can disable key repeat on the OS using Terminal.</p>

<p>What makes this problem a little tricky is even if you turn off key repeat once, it will spontaneously turn back on a few minutes later.</p>

<p>So I ended up writing a shell script that disables key repeat every 15 seconds.  When I kill the script, it reverts back to normal settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash

trap 'xset r rate 500 30; exit' SIGINT

while true; do
    xset r off
    sleep 15
done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can save this as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nokeyrepeat.sh</code> and run it in Terminal with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sh nokeyrepeat.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code> as an alias:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alias nokeyrepeat="sh /path/to/nokeyrepeat.sh"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Reset Terminal so it reloads the config:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ source ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run it easily from any directory:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nokeyrepeat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTROL-C</code> will kill the script.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-dedicated-server">Running A Dedicated Server</h2>

<p>These instructions for running a dedicated server on Linux require some advanced stuff, but if you made it this far you might be up for it.</p>

<p>If, by chance, you have a home server (as I do!) you will need to transfer the game files from your local machine over to the remote machine.</p>

<p>You don’t have to install the game using the installer, especially since your remote server probably doesn’t have a screen or user interface.</p>

<p>I used SCP to transfer the files:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ scp -r /path/to/terraria user@serverip:/path/to/terraria
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the game files are on the server, you connect to that server using SSH:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ssh user@serverip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you create a config file for the Terraria server to use:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>world=/path/to/your/world.wld
autocreate=0
port=7777
maxplayers=8
password=
motd=Welcome to the server!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use a world that you have on your local machine by moving it over to the server.  I’ve done it several times.</p>

<p>To start the Terraria server w/ your config file, you’d do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /path/to/terraria/game
$ ./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64 -config /path/to/serverconfig.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But as you can see, the server runs in your Terminal session, and you’re not going to leave that Terminal session open forever.  Closing the remote SSH connection would kill your dedicated server.</p>

<p>So, you can use an app called TMUX to run the Terminal session in the background:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt install tmux
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wrote this shell script to automatically provision the TMUX session and run the server in the background:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

config="/path/to/serverconfig.txt"
session="myterrariaserver"

# Kill existing session if it exists
tmux kill-session -t "$session" 2&gt;/dev/null

# Create a new session
tmux new-session -d -s "$session"

# Send commands to the session
tmux send-keys -t "$session" "cd /path/to/terraria/game &amp;&amp; ./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64 -config $config" C-m
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you could save this script as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runserver.sh</code> and fire the whole thing off:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sh runserver.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you rerun the script it will kill off the currently running server and renew it.</p>

<p>To kill off all currently running sessions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ tmux kill-server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Dedicated servers save the world file every 5 minutes, I think.</p>

<p>I didn’t even discuss firewall settings on your server – that’s a whole different article!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To the rare person who read this far, congratulations.</p>

<p>I’m trying to put up all my how-to instructions just in case it’s helpful to others – tho I know it’s helpful to me when I revisit these issues.</p>

<p>Enjoy a great game!</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your character files and world files are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/Terraria</code>.</li>
  <li>I change my resolution to 1080p prior to loading this game.  It fixes some alt-tab issues on my 4k display.</li>

<p>What can I say that needs to be said?  This is the greatest strategy game of the early 2000s.  I played it, you played it, we know what this is.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “why would anybody want to play this?  The Definitive Edition (2019) is so great.”  Ah contrare, mon capitan.</p>

<p>“But the DE made so many gameplay improvements!”  It added nothing but bloat and expansion packs and abysmal matchmaking connections.</p>

<p>You might say, “Well at least play the HD Edition (2013)!”  My sweet summer child, the HD improvements are barely noticable, and that game only works on Steam – you can’t even play a LAN game.</p>

<p>The original game is the best version.  It’s the version I play and it’s the version you should play too.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>You need two install files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Age of Kings</li>
  <li>The Conquerors</li>
</ul>

<p>You install those on your Wine Bottle and prepare for the next steps.  You’re going to need the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=11438">Conquerors Patch v1.0c</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/?pvdprrr81pcdoad">No CD Patch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://userpatch.aiscripters.net/">UserPatch v1.5</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You install the patch v1.0c first.  Then you extract and paste in the nocd replacement exe, which will go in the game <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">age2_x1/</code> folder.</p>

<p>Then we get to the UserPatch file.  This is the file that brings the game up to snuff.  You’re going to get all the bug fixes, the widescreen resolutions, the works.</p>

<p>Copy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SetupAoC.exe</code> into your game directory and run it.  My settings are posted below, but note that while this app is open press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F5</code> and it will make some new options appear that were hidden options.  In those new options be sure you turn on the alternate chat for Wine.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/vanilla/screenshots/aoe2_install_01.png"><img src="/assets/img/vanilla/screenshots/aoe2_install_01.png" alt="AOE2 Install 01" /></a>

<a href="/assets/img/vanilla/screenshots/aoe2_install_04.png"><img src="/assets/img/vanilla/screenshots/aoe2_install_04.png" alt="AOE2 Install 01" /></a></p>

<p>If you launched the game right now, you’d hear music but only see a black screen.</p>

<p>The secret sauce to finally get this working is to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddraw.dll</code> to your “Override DLLs” setting in Bottles, and then drop the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddraw.dll</code> from <a href="https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/releases">CNC-DDraw</a> into the game directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">age2_x1/</code>.</p>

<p>That should be it, you should be good to go.  Note you’re going to launch the game from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">age2_x1/age2_x1.exe</code> and you’ll ignore all the other executables.</p>

<p>Some parting notes regarding the differences between OG AOE2 and DE AOE2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you make waypoints for units, you shift click all the points and then have to make a final right click anywhere on the screen to get the unit to start moving.</li>
  <li>Instead of making your mill auto-reseed as a one time ON button, you have to queue up reseeds that consume wood at the time of purchase.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are literally the only “QOL” changes that the new version added, and they are so pathetically minor.</p>

<p>One of the great city builder games from the past, by Impressions Games.</p>

<p>I will do a separate post someday about Caesar III (which can be played natively on Linux w/ the <a href="https://github.com/Keriew/augustus">Augustus</a> engine).</p>

<p>Things to know about this game for the modern era is that there are two open source efforts to port the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Banderi/Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a> - the original effort that is now defunct</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dalerank/Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> - a new effort that is still far from playable</li>
</ul>

<p>So in the meantime, I’m going to try and play the original.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>To install this on Wine, you’ll need the game Pharaoh and the expansion Cleopatra.</p>

<p>You’ll also need a few additional files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pharaoh.heavengames.com/downloads/showfile.php?fileid=1103">Cleopatra 2.1 Patch</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/files/vanilla/Pharaoh%20Widescreen%20Fixes.zip">Widescreen Fixes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So you’ll install the patch and then prepare to implement a modern widescreen fix.</p>

<p>Find your installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pharaoh.exe</code> file and rename it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pharaoh_ORIGINAL.exe</code>.  Then find a widescreen replacement file in the zip you extracted.</p>

<p>(I actually built these fixes myself on my Windows machine using this <a href="https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=14149&amp;start=330">Pharaoh Resizer</a> tool.  There are other widescreen fixes out there but this Pharaoh Resizer app has the best results.)</p>

<p>If you launched the game right now, you’d hear music but only see a black screen.</p>

<p>The secret sauce to finally get this working is to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddraw.dll</code> to your “Override DLLs” setting in Bottles, and then drop the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddraw.dll</code> from <a href="https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/releases">CNC-DDraw</a> into the game directory.</p>

<p>To get the resolution change to take effect, you’ll have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Launch the game for the first time</li>
  <li>Get into an actual game map</li>
  <li>Choose display options and pick 1024x786</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the game will glitch into the widescreen resolution patch you had implemented.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// add to the bottom
alias mouse1="xinput set-prop 10 \"libinput Accel Speed\" 0"
alias mouse2="xinput set-prop 10 \"libinput Accel Speed\" -0.5"
alias 1080p="xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode 1920x1080 &amp;&amp; mouse2"
alias screenreset="xrandr --output eDP-1 --auto &amp;&amp; mouse1"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Reset Terminal so it reloads the config:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ source ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is handy for playing old games by setting my screen quickly to 1080p.  Not all my games need it, but some of them do.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// change
$ 1080p

// change back
$ screenreset
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many of the old games weren’t designed for 4k resolutions and this resolves many of those issues.  It’s also helpful for newer games bc the lower resolution improves video performance.</p>

<p>These commands also change the mouse speed to be proportional to the new resolution.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="linux" /><category term="terminal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quickly change your screen to 1080p.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DemonStar (1997)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/09/22/demonstar.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DemonStar (1997)" /><published>2024-09-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/09/22/demonstar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/09/22/demonstar.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

My hope is to keep these old games alive.</p>

<p>The old games were better.</p>

<p>You owned them, could install them on as many computers as you liked, and you didn’t need anyone’s permission to play them.</p>

<p>I resent the trend of newer games being dependent on company servers which can be taken away from the player over time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Xbox Live on 360 just shut down a couple months ago, all those multiplayer games are GONE.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GOG just announced they are taking down dozens of games from their service.  Good luck finding non-DRM versions of those.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Archive.org announced last week that they are being forced to take down hundreds of thousands of books due to a publishing lawsuit.</p>

  <li>
    <p>I just tried to install AOE2 HD (2013) the other day only to find out you can’t use it w/out Steam.</p>

</ul>

<p>The history of our world is being erased and replaced with garbage.</p>

<p>We’re being herded like cattle into a world were we own nothing, all the media we consume is leased to us and can be taken away – or changed – at any moment.</p>

<p>It’s going to be the autistic archivists and game pirates who preserve the good stuff for the future.</p>

<p>This post is intended as a running (and repeatedly updated) post with tips for playing old Windows games on Linux using Wine.</p>

<p>I’m going to make posts specific to particular games, but I need a post with introductory help that I can refer back to.</p>

<h2 id="wine">Wine</h2>

<p>The app you want is <a href="https://usebottles.com/">Bottles</a>. The easiest way to install Bottles is probably on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.usebottles.bottles">Flathub</a>.</p>

<p>Bottles is a UI for <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, and it’s Wine that actually runs your games.  The hard part about Wine, though, is that it’s command line only.</p>

<p>What’s great about Bottles is it gets you out of the command line and lets you just click buttons to manage your Windows OS.</p>

<p>As someone who is good with Terminal, this is still a much better route to go and I’m happy to recommend this app to others.</p>

<p>Once you figure out the UI of Bottles it’s pretty straightforward and easy to manipulate the OS to accomidate your games.</p>

<p>BONUS: You can make backups of your Bottles.  In my case, I have a son who really likes these games and it makes it easy for me to pass him pre-installed games.</p>

<p>Most of the posts on this blog are going to be instructions about how I got my games to work, and I’ll be using these terms below…</p>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<p>Terms you need to know about as you setup your Windows OS in Bottles.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Arch” - Around 2015, games switched from being 32-bit to 64-bit architecture, and your games have to be installed on a Bottle that has the right architecture. Likely you want <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32-bit</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Runner” - The Bottles app lets you choose different engines to run Windows.  I exclusively use the Wine install that I manage myself on my computer, as opposed to the ones Bottles lets you install. For me <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sys-wine-9.0</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“DXVK” - A compatibility layer that turns Windows DirectX video driver API commands into Vulkan video driver API commands (and makes it run better). For me <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dxvk-1.10</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Discrete Graphics” - This has to do with if your machine has a dedicated video card for games, and if so, you definitely want this on.  You want to be using your beefy graphics card to play your games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Gamescope” - I just recently discovered this and it’s pretty handy.  It forces your game to play in a window size of your choosing.  I set mine to 1920x1080.  Most of my games don’t need it, but some of them it really helps by a) scaling the game to my screen, and b) letting ALT-TAB work w/out freezing the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Windows Version” - Sometimes a game will tell you that it won’t run on the version of Windows that you picked.  I usually use Windows XP but sometimes I have to move it up to Windows 8 or something.  Generally this setting rarely matters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Command Arguments” - This setting in Bottles is where you can pass arguments / parameters to a game when it’s launched.  It would usually be something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-nointro</code> or similar that the game would recognize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Feral Gamemode” - This is a settings package for Linux machines that sets it up for maximum gaming performance.  You basically want this on and you’ll just leave it on.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pro-tips--troubleshooting">Pro Tips &amp; Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you are looking for an old game that you don’t actually possess, you can probably find it on <a href="https://archive.org">Archive.org</a>.  Many of these games are now freeware and the companies that created them no longer exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When using Bottles, some features I turn on or off depending on the game – such as Gamescope. I make a little note reminding me in the game title if that game needs it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to install games on Bottles the files have to actually be on the Windows drive.  The Bottle can’t see any files outside of itself, which is a security thing.  That means you might have to mount an ISO file for a game install and manually copy the install files to your Bottle disk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the games have dependencies that they require, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d3dx9</code> (DirectX9).  Bottles has a section where you can find and install these, but you might have difficulty discovering that you need them at all for your game.  My posts here about games I’ve installed should help with that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes you can get on the <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/">Wine</a> or <a href="https://www.protondb.com">Proton</a> sites, type in your game, and find a tip that tells you about some command argument or dependency you need to get your game working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Bottles won’t run your game or is behaving weird, just turn it off and turn it back on to see if it fixes your problem.  You might also do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code> and reboot your machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Bottles still won’t run your game – and you are freaking out thinking you’ll never get to play your games ever again – you can try a hard update on the app: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flatpak update com.usebottles.bottles</code>.  I had to do this once when Diablo II refused to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider changing your computer resolution to 1080p (1920x1080) before you complain about tiny UIs in your games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your game (or installer) crashes immediately when you try to run it, you might need to check if it’s a 32-bit/64-bit game and you’re using the wrong architecture.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="black-screen">Black Screen</h2>

<p>I’m making this issue a distinct category w/ it’s own header.</p>

<p>If you have a game that is giving you a black screen, but you can hear the music playing, it is probably something easily fixable.</p>

<p>I have had this problem w/ several games and all I had to do is grab the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddraw.dll</code> from <a href="https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/releases">CNC-DDraw</a>.  You put that file in your game directory, and then in Bottles settings you go to Override DLLs and input that name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddraw.dll</code>.</p>

<p>Then blamo, your game will work.</p>

<p>DDraw is a video library that Windows uses, and FunkyFr3sh re-programmed it to make super old games work w/ modern computers.  By putting that file in your game directory you override the default Windows one.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-install-wine">How To Install Wine</h2>

<p>If you’re like me, and you want Bottles to use the version of Wine you have on your machine, you will need this.</p>

<p>Because some Linux systems come with old versions of Wine, here are some Terminal commands to get the latest:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// remove existing
$ sudo apt-get remove --purge wine* --autoremove

// tap repository
$ wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
$ sudo gpg -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/winehq.key.gpg --dearmor winehq.key
$ sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main"

// update and install
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
$ sudo apt install winetricks

// check your version
$ wine --version

// how to switch from stable to development
$ sudo apt remove winehq-stable
$ sudo apt install winehq-devel
</code></pre></div></div>
